## Reporting a Vulnerability

For the most part, contacting me via Github should work out. In case you cannot
reach me in this fashion, use 7Saturn@gmx.de.

I will look into the matter (but probably not right away) and if possible (for
me that is), correct the issue. Helpful advice for that kind of task is always
welcome.
